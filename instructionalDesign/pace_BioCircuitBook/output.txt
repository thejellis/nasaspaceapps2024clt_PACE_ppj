                                                  (OCI), is an ocean color mission but, as its name implies, it will also be used to study
                                                  important aspects of atmospheric science. Since the mission’s primary focus is ocean

                                                  In addition to dissolved and inorganic material such as salts, ocean water contains a vari-

                                                  food chain and produce over half of the oxygen we breathe. Phytoplankton also play

                                         OCI Builds on NASA’s Ocean Color Heritage
   The PACE Ocean Color Instrument (OCI) builds on a firm foundation of ocean color observations at NASA
   that includes a 17-year continuous record of satellite ocean color observations, and many more years of expe-
   rience (see graphs below). The Coastal Zone Color Scanner (CZCS), launched in 1978 onboard Nimbus-7,
   was the first instrument that measured ocean color from space. Intended to be a “proof-of-concept” mission,
   CZCS did that—and much more. CZCS observations ceased in 1986, but research continued for many years
   thereafter that laid the groundwork for the missions that followed*.

   While some climate data records (CDRs) (e.g., ozone) are continuous from the Nimbus era to the present,
   such is not the case with ocean color. There was an 11-year gap between the end of CZCS observations and
   the next NASA ocean color mission**: the Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS), launched in
   1997 onboard the SeaStar (later renamed Orbview-2) satellite. Despite a challenging start—SeaStar was ini-
   tially deployed upside down!—SeaWiFS proved itself resilient and went on to provide quality global ocean-
   color observations for over a decade.

   Ocean color measurements continued into the NASA Earth Observing System (EOS) era. Two of the flag-
   ship EOS missions carried the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS): Terra, launched
   in 1999, and Aqua, launched in 2002. More recently, the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite
   (VIIRS), launched in 2012 onboard the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (NPP), also obtains
   ocean-color measurements. VIIRS will also fly on upcoming Joint Polar Satellite System missions, the first of
   which (JPSS-1) is scheduled for launch in late 2016.

Possible Enhancements to OCI

A number of possible enhancements to the base PACE mission have been proposed.
While all of these enhancements would make the mission more scientifically robust,
they come with possible technical tradeoffs: Enhancements might result in delays in
launch schedule; decreasing the mission’s technology readiness level7 (which implies
more risk of failure); increased payload mass leading to increased power requirements;

 Technology readiness levels are a means to classify how “ready” a given system component or
instrument is. For more on how the Earth Science Technology Office defines them in the con-
text of NASA missions, see esto.nasa.gov/technologists_trl.html.

                                              The possible enhancements to the PACE OCI that are under consideration would push
                                              beyond the minimum mission requirements and enable the mission to address some of

                                              The second area that the addition of a polarimeter would help feeds into the mission’s
                                              primary objective: ocean color. A PACE polarimeter would provide an unprecedented
                                              opportunity to develop novel joint ocean-atmosphere retrievals that may improve

                                              Furthermore, polarimetric measurements of the ocean surface may enable estimation
                                              of the angular distribution of the underwater light field, which could additionally
                                              shed light on the optical properties of near-surface marine particles.

                                              Several polarimeter options exist as of this writing: no polarimeter; a polarimeter devel-
                                              opment directed to the NASA/Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL); and an open-competed
                                              (or contributed) polarimeter, with GSFC excluded. Under these options, the Project is
                                              exploring several measurement concepts—temporal modulation, spectral modulation,
                                              amplitude splitting, and sequential measurement strategies can all be used to provide
                                              imaging of both the total and polarized intensity of light. Assuming that a polarimeter
                                              is added to PACE, it will certainly constitute a significant enhancement to the base
                                              mission—but it will also increase the technical complexity of the mission.

Societal Benefits

Science for its own sake is not enough to provide the needed support to perform such
activities. Particularly in a resource-limited environment, benefits to society at large—
most commonly through applications of the data—must be demonstrated, and PACE
will amply address this requirement. Specifically, the advanced capabilities of the
PACE OCI over heritage instruments will enable improvement in the following cat-
egories of science applications:
