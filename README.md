## Project description

The main branch is not currently worked on as the feature branch instructionalDesign holds prelimary data, code, and output
In the instructionalDesign branch contains a python notebook that was built and run in google colab. The code is in alpha and will not run without adjustments for api keys
The website data is housed on the wix;

## Who this project is for

This project is intended as an initial conceptual design, utilizing NASA PACE data, NASA Open APIs, and the distilBert and stable-diffusion model, for the ability for educational material to be generated through a combination of NASA API data and Technical Documentation to provide individualized education materials for the purpose and location. This is a submission through the 2024 NASA Space Apps Challenge in Charlotte for the PACE in the Classroom Challenge.

Before using nasaspaceapps2024clt_PACE_ppj, ensure you:

* Are On the instructionalDesign branch
* Openai downgrade 
* Packages found in google colab folder

## Instructions for using Biocircuit Learning Auto-Generated Educational Material

Get started with Biocircuit Learning Auto-Generated Educational Material by forking a copy to work on the data. The code was developed in google colab.

To develop the output slides, utilize the quarto markdown file to render.
